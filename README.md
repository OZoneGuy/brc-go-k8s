# 1 Billion Row Challenge - Go and k8s

This repo is an attempt to bring the 1BRC to k8s. The purpose is not to optimize the program itself perse, but to set up the environment and explore challenges of distributed software and cross "instance" communication. Therefore, the original code will not be mine and will be credited to the author. Note that changes will be required to the original code to work with the new environment.

Should be attached to an article to track progress and document it.
